## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
install.packages("rpart")
install.packages("party")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(rpart)
library(party)
D1 = read.csv("intelligent_tutor.csv")
c.tree <- rpart(action ~ hint.y + complete, method="class", data=D1) #Notice the standard R notion for a formula X ~ Y

#Look at the error of this tree
printcp(c.tree)

#Plot the tree
post(c.tree, file = "tree.ps", title = "Session Completion Action: 1 - Ask teacher, 2 - Start new session, 3 - Give up")
```

Visulaize score data to decide "leaves"
```{r}
hist(D1$score)
```


Define "Leaves": 

```{r}
score<= 0.4 intervene, score between 0.4 and 0.8, monitor, core >= 0.8, no action. 
Then generate the regression tree by using ctree. And plot.
```
```{r}
D1$advice <- ifelse(D1$score <=0.4,"intervene", ifelse(D1$score > 0.4 & D1$score <=0.8, "monitor", "no action"))
score_ctree <- ctree(factor(advice) ~ prior_prob_count + prior_percent_correct + hints, D1)
plot(score_ctree)
```
